# FTP Protocol - Fart To Pump 💨🚀

The most degen meme website ever created. A cheeky parody of the File Transfer Protocol, but instead of transferring files, you're transferring... well, gas to the moon.

## What is this?

FTP Protocol is an interactive meme website where users can:
- **Charge up their fart power** by holding down the big button

- **Compete on the leaderboard** for the biggest pumps
- **Watch their stats grow** with persistent localStorage tracking

- 🎨 **Degen Aesthetics**: Neon colors, retro terminal vibes, space theme
- 📱 **Responsive**: Works on desktop and mobile

## Tech Stack
